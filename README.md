# Self Study CS

## Introduction

A collection of books, resources, and courses for self-studying Computer Science.

## Who is this for?

I've made this curriculum for people like myself, who are already working as software development professionals and/or have some programming experience, but wish to round out their computer science fundamentals. I made this mostly for myself, but anyone else who may find it useful is welcome to use it / make it their own.

This curriculum is *not* for those looking to quickly career change to a job in software development. These resources are thorough and often more rigorous than one would likely need to get an entry-level job in software development. This isn't to say that going through these resources is not beneficial for a career in software, but it is most definitely not the quickest path to change careers. For those looking to change careers into software development, I recommend the [coding-interview-university](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) or [OSU Postbacc in Computer Science](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/academic/online-cs-postbacc).

## Guiding principals

I built this curriculum with these principals in mind.

+ **Quality over quantity** - A focus on quality, well respected learning material - not a giant, thrown together list of articles, MOOCs, and videos.
+ **Textbooks over MOOCs where possible** - A preference for well regarded textbooks & university lectures over MOOCs<sup>1</sup>.
+ **Fundamentals** - A focus on CS fundamentals, not on "what's hot right now."
+ **Self-contained** - Prerequisites, even those for basic mathematics, are not overlooked.
+ **Core math included** - CS is, at its core, a branch of applied mathematics.  This curriculum treats it as such.
+ **Suitable for self instruction** - Materials are convenient, effective, and easy to consume for the motivated self-learner.

<sup>1</sup> MOOCs are great and have their place, but often lack rigor, vary in quality, and can be taken down / changed without warning. When MOOCs are used in this curriculum, they are produced by well-regarded universities.

## References

Much of this curriculum was heavily inspired by the resources from [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/). I highly recommend reading through their website.

## How to use this curriculum

For each subject, there will be a textbook and associated video series (usually YouTube). Do your best to work through the entire textbook and do practice problems where applicable. Use the videos to supplement your learning.

## Curriculum

### Core Math

#### Pre-calculus

**Book**: [Openstax: Algebra & Trigonometry, Abramson 2e](https://openstax.org/details/books/algebra-and-trigonometry-2e)
**Videos**: [Professor Leonard's Precalculus - College Algebra/Trigonometry YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDesaqWTN6ESsmwELdrzhcGiRhk5DjwLP)
**Why learn?** Computer science itself is really just an applied branch of mathematics, so a strong foundation in fundamental high school mathematics is extremely important. Unfortunately, the state of the US education system leaves much to be desired when it comes to pre-college math education. This leaves many students with gaps in their knowledge of funamental mathematics, which can have detrimental consequences when trying to learn more advanced topics.
**Why these resource?** Many might recommend other pre-calculus texts than the Openstax one recommended here, however I use this one for a few reasons. First, it's free.  Second, the online format is *very* user-friendly (e.g. easy to use links between questions and solutions). Finally, given the abundance of pre-calculus resources on the internet, it is very easy for someone to supplement this book in places where it may be lacking or where students need additional explanations. As for Professor Leonard, he hardly needs justification. A quick Google search for the best college math videos will reveal his popularity / quality.

#### Calculus

**Book**: [Openstax: Calculus: Volume 1, Strang & Herman](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1)
**Videos**: [Professor Leonard's Calculus 1 YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYyARMqiaag&list=PLF797E961509B4EB5)
**Why Learn?** See my "Why learn?" section for [pre-calculus](#pre-calculus). Even though many CS curriculums at universities, especially those embedded in engineering schools, require students to take calc 1-3 & differential equations, we stop at calculus 1. This is because, in most cases, fundamental CS education does not require mathematical knowledge beyond calculus 1. Students who wish to get into more specialized & math heavy computer science topics (e.g. machine learning or computer graphics) may continue studying calculus 2-3 and differential equations using other resources or continuing on with the remaining Openstax books and Professor Leonard playlists.
